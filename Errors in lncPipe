In process Run_FastP
error  Missing output file(s) `*qc.fq.gz` expected by process `Run_FastP (samplename)`

Solution in  fastp -i !{fastq_file[0]} -o !{samplename}.qc.gz -h !{samplename}_fastp.html --disable_adapter_trimming. Add 'fq'
Final result - fastp -i !{fastq_file[0]} -o !{samplename}.qc.fq.gz -h !{samplename}_fastp.html --disable_adapter_trimming

In process fastq_hisat2_alignment_For_discovery
error in -t !{hisat2 threads}. There is no such variable/

Solution change !{hisat2 threads} on 2 or random number.

In process Predict_coding_abilities_by_CPAT
error in output: file "novel.longRNA.CPAT.out"
 
Solution - add "ORF_prob.tsv". Final resoult need to look like this - "novel.longRNA.CPAT.out.ORF_prob.tsv"

In process > Filter_lncRNA_by_coding_potential_result
error in wrong columns. "awk '$4 >1&&$5=="lncRNA"{print $1}' novel.longRNA.txt" (on this step)

Solution - change $5 column on $2 column.

In process > Summary_renaming_and_classification
error with gtf format. 
"Error: no valid ID found for GFF record"

lines with transcript_id=="", they don't contain a valid ID, and so StringTie is complaining. 
Its always a bit of the worry to work out what to do with a the transcript_id field on gene lines in a GTF file. 
The orignal GTF format didn't contain gene lines, but they appear to have crept in at some point. 
The ENSEMBL files just don't have a transcript_id field on their gene lines, but i bet that trips StringTie up as well.

Solution - "awk '$3 != "gene" ' my_annotation.gtf > my_annotation_no_genes.gtf"

process Build_kallisto_index_of_GTF_for_quantification
error in index build. Error: repeated name in FASTA file

Solution - awk '/^>/{f=!d[$1];d[$1]=1}f' in.fa > out.fa before kallisto index build
